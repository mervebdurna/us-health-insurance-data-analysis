# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Data Description
age: Age of primary beneficiary

sex: Insurance contractor gender, female / male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / ) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

# Hypothesis Testing
A few hypothesis testing will be performed to check the findings observed in the EDA notebook are statistically significant or not.

## Objectives to be tested

Are medical claims made by smokers greater than those who don't smoke ?
Is the BMI of females lower than the BMI of males?
Is the proportion of smokers significantly different in different genders?
Is the distribution of BMI in across different regions are the same?
Hypothesis testing will be performed by following the steps below, respectively.

1. State the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
2. Decide the type of hypothesis testing
3. Check the assumptions
4. Perform hyptohesis testing
5. Interpret results

## Notes :

* Whether the assumptions are met will be checked by visualization techniques or hypothesis testing. If not met, the appropriate non-parametric tests will be used.
* The hypothesis test results will be interpreted with a p-value instead of test statistics.
